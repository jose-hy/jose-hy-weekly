Hi! My name is Jose, and I'm a CS Major in the OSSD class this semester. I also have two minors in Web Development and Integrated Design & Media (IDM). 

### More Information

I'm interested in the tech industry, and also want to learn more about the healthcare industry as well. This is because I came into NYU as a Biochem major, then swapped over to CS in my second semester, so I still want to learn about the healthcare industry and how I can still contribute to that field through what I'm studying now.
