## My Final Blog Ever.

This past week was the final complete week of classes for me, both in the semester and in my college career. I got to see most of my classmates presentations and what they did, and I will say getting to see how they explained and showed what they worked on for half the semester helped me in wording and displaying my information for my group project tomorrow.

As I'm typing this final blog for the semester, I'm also actively working on our presentation! We have the groundwork and general flow done, we just need to work on the specifics such as which issues we really want to focus on and shed some light on. I'm pretty interested to see how our presentation comes together and what we've chosen to discuss. And after that, I'm finished! Thankfully, we're going first in the list of groups who are presenting tomorrow, so we can be over and out with the presentation. 

After this class, I'm wondering how much of what I've learned and taken from here I'll actually use during the summer or when I have a job. The job part I'm unsure of, but for the summer, I can definitely contribute and have a look around some open source projects when I'm bored and wanting to work on something. Open Source can still be pretty fun, and I want to explore more of what I didn't get a chance to do in this class. I think overall I am glad I took this class after knowing what I got out of it.
